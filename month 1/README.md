# Frontend Foundations — Submission

This project satisfies the Month‑1 requirements:
- Semantic HTML5 + a11y (skip link, landmarks, keyboardable tabs)
- CSS Grid/Flex layouts (**10+ patterns** on Components page)
- SCSS source (`assets/scss/*`) with variables & mixins, and compiled CSS (`assets/css/styles.css`)
- ES6 modules (`assets/js/components.js`, `assets/js/main.js`)
- Multi‑page site (Home, Services, About, Blog, Components, Contact)
- Cross‑browser friendly, progressive enhancement.

## Run
Open `index.html` with Live Server (or any static server).

## Edit SCSS
You can compile SCSS to CSS using any Sass tool. The compiled CSS here is prewritten to match the SCSS content.
